The first Juz – Al Fatihah and Al Baqarah

The Holy Quran is mainly composed of Surahs (chapters) and further split into Ayats (verses) in every Surah. The Holy Quran is further divided into thirty equal portions; each of them is called a Juz (Plural: Ajiza). The division of these Juz does not fall evenly along but is only there to make it easier for the reader to distribute the reading over a month. This is particularly important during the Holy month of Ramadan because it is recommended to complete the Holy Quran during the month. The first Jus spans over the Surahs of Al Fatihah and a portion of Al Baqarah.

Chapters And Verses Included In The First Juz

The first Juz starts with the first Ayat of Al Fatihah and continues partway through Al Baqarah till the 141st Verse.

The first chapter is a summary of faith revealed by Allah to Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) while he was in Makkah before the migration to Madinah. Most of the second chapter, Al Baqarah, was unveiled in the initial years of the migration to Madinah. During the time when the Muslim community was establishing itself as a social and political center for the Muslim Ummah. 
The Main Themes Of The First Juz

The first Juz deals with several issues related to Guidance, the history of previous Ummahs and Allah almighty's governance on the Earth. The second chapter begins with the statement that it is Allah who revealed the Holy Quran for the guidance of those who are conscious of Him. The Holy Prophet (ﷺ) has said:

"The Book of Allah contains right guidance, the light, and whoever adheres to it and holds it fast, he is upon right guidance and whosoever deviates from it goes astray." [Sahih Muslim 2408 c]

Hence, those who seek guidance from Allah will be the only ones who will benefit from the Holy Quran. Allah also mentions stories within Surah Al Baqarah about other Ummahs and how they responded to Allah and his guidance through this messengers.

The opening chapter is often called "The Lord’s Prayer" in Islam because it is a Dua from Allah and is repeatedly recited during the daily prayers by the Muslims. This chapter sums up the relationship between Allah and the Humans in worship. In all prayers (Namaz) we start by praising Allah and imploring him for his guidance on the straight path which, in turn, will guide us in all matters of our lives.

The second chapter, which is the longest chapter of the Holy Quran, "The Cow" (Al Baqarah). The name of this chapter corresponds to a story told within a section of this chapter, which starts from the 67th verse. The story is about the followers of Hazrat Musa (Moses). The early section of this chapter lays out the relationship between Allah and the situation of mankind. In it, Allah sends out messengers and guidance; and the people choose how they will respond. They will either believe and become a believer, they will reject the faith altogether and become a disbeliever or they will become hypocrites by showing that they believe in Allan while harboring evil intentions regarding the faith and the believers.

The first Juz also includes the story of the creation of mankind, one of the numerous places where it has been mentioned, to remind us of the many blessing of Allah. After telling us of his graces, Allah introduces us to the stories of previous Ummahs and how they responded to Allah's guidance, and how they responded to the messenger sent to them. Allah specifically mentions the stories of Prophets Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, and the difficulties they had to go through to bring Allah guidance to their Ummahs.
